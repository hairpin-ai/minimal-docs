*Update
======

This section will cover the apply of the new update

* * *

The core components when you want to upgrade will include:

*   **src/theme**
*   **src/layouts**
*   **src/components**
*   **src/utils**
*   **src/hooks**

Depending on your needs, you can copy components from the new version to your current version.

Copy and overwrite only the elements you are working on.

**The components [here](https://minimals.cc/components) are always the latest. Please check the code that we have attached.**

> Let's use Git to see the changes.

  

**The product is built on React MUI so you can check the changes at:**

*   [Changelog](/changelog)
*   [https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Compare the components you want to work with the new version so that copying and overwriting can work properly.

> Since this is a product that uses many dependencies and has many components, you will also need to manually check the components you are working on to update it.
